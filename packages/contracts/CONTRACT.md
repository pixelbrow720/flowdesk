# FlowDesk Snapshot Contract — `schema_version` 1

The **Snapshot** is the canonical per-`(instrument, minute)` object produced by the
compute engine, served by the API, and rendered by the frontend. It has two
byte-for-byte equivalent implementations that MUST stay 1:1:

| Language | File | Validator |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TypeScript | `packages/contracts/src/snapshot.ts` | `zod` → `parseSnapshot()` / `safeParseSnapshot()` |
| Python | `services/engine/src/engine/schema.py` | `pydantic` v2 → `parse_snapshot()` |

> **Versioning rule (MUST):** `schema_version` MUST be bumped on **any breaking
> change** — renaming a field, changing a type, changing units/semantics, or
> removing a field. Bump it in **both** files in the same change. Additive,
> backward-compatible fields MAY be introduced without a bump only if every
> consumer treats unknown fields as optional (current validators are strict, so
> in practice a bump is required).

Snapshot schema; **PRD #4** = regime; **PRD #9** = session state machine.

| `price_grid` | `number[]` | index points | Price grid defining the field's axis. | PRD #8 §3 |
| `gamma` | `number[]` | USD per 1% move | Gamma field value at each grid point. | PRD #0 §5 |
| `delta` | `number[]` | USD notional | Delta field value at each grid point. | PRD #8 §3 |

**Invariant (enforced by both validators):** `price_grid` defines the grid, so
`gamma.length === delta.length === price_grid.length`.

## `levels` (Levels)

| Field | Type | Unit | Meaning | PRD source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `call_walls` | `number[]` | index points | Call walls by GAMMA-DOLLAR (`gamma * OI` per side), STATIC all day, ordered by rank (index 0 = rank 1). Divergence #2 → option B. | PRD #0 §2 |

## `ohlc` (OHLC, optional)

Underlying (futures forward) OHLC for this minute. Optional/additive: absent or
`null` for snapshots produced before OHLC capture was wired — does **not** bump
`schema_version`.

| Field | Type | Unit | Meaning | PRD source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `o` | `number` | index points | Open: first futures trade price in the minute. | PRD #4 |

## `hiro` (Hiro, optional)

Cumulative dealer **delta-notional hedging flow** since the RTH open (HIRO,
`engine.hiro`). Optional/additive (Divergence #5 → option A): absent or `null`
when not captured — does **not** bump `schema_version`. Units are USD
delta-notional; positive = net dealer BUYING pressure (bullish), negative =
selling pressure. These are the *current* cumulative values for the minute; the
intraday HIRO line is reconstructed FE-side from the per-minute frame sequence
(like the forward-price line), so no per-trade path is embedded per frame.

| Field | Type | Unit | Meaning | PRD source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `total` | `number` | USD delta-notional | Cumulative HIRO, all legs, since RTH open. | FlowGreeks |
| `calls` | `number` | USD delta-notional | Cumulative HIRO from call trades only. | FlowGreeks |
| `puts` | `number` | USD delta-notional | Cumulative HIRO from put trades only. | FlowGreeks |
| `zerodte` | `number` | USD delta-notional | Cumulative HIRO from 0DTE trades (`T < 1/365`). | FlowGreeks |
| `retail` | `number` | USD delta-notional | Cumulative HIRO from the heuristic retail proxy (odd-lot size; indicative only). | FlowGreeks |

## `synthetic_oi` (SyntheticOi, optional) — **EXPERIMENTAL**

Synthetic-OI #4 positioning lens (`engine.synthetic_oi`). Optional/additive
(mirrors `hiro`/`ohlc`): absent or `null` when not captured — does **not** bump
`schema_version`. Dealer position per strike = carried-in open interest with the
static long-call/short-put sign, **updated** by native CME aggressor-signed flow
weighted by `w`; `gex = Σ Γ·Q·M·F²·0.01`. Thin strikes (gamma unsolved upstream)
are **skipped, not fabricated**.

> **This is EXPERIMENTAL and NOT price-validated** — structurally checked on a
> 4-day sample only. It lives **alongside** the locked VOL-based product GEX
> (`profile[].net_gex`) and does **not** replace it. Consumers MUST treat it as
> indicative, not authoritative. See
> `docs/research/empirical/synthetic-oi-0dte.md`.

| Field | Type | Unit / domain | Meaning | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `gex` | `number` | USD per 1% move | Net synthetic-OI GEX at weight `w`. EXPERIMENTAL. | FlowGreeks |
| `sign` | `-1 \| 0 \| 1` | enum | Sign of `gex`. | FlowGreeks |
| `gex_static` | `number` | USD per 1% move | `w=0` pure-OI GEX baseline (SpotGamma-classic). | FlowGreeks |
| `w` | `number` | `[0, 1]` | Open/close flow weight used for `gex` (`0` = pure OI, `1` = full flow update). | FlowGreeks |

> **`synthetic_oi_tiered`** (top-level, same `SyntheticOi` shape) is synthetic-OI
> **#6**: identical model, but the aggressor flow is multiplied by a per-trade
> **size-tier** weight before entering `Q` — retail odd-lots downweighted toward 0,
> institutional blocks upweighted. The size thresholds are **UNVALIDATED guesses**
> (`engine.synthetic_oi.BLOCK_MIN_SIZE` / `RETAIL_MAX_SIZE`), per-instrument; sweep
> them on the tape. With all tier weights = 1 it reduces exactly to `synthetic_oi`.
>
> **`synthetic_oi_decay`** (top-level, same `SyntheticOi` shape) is synthetic-OI
> **#5**: identical model, but the flow is multiplied by a per-trade **time-decay**
> weight `exp(−ln2·age/half_life)` before entering `Q` — recent flow outweighs old,
> mitigating intraday round-trip double-count. The half-life
> (`engine.synthetic_oi.DEFAULT_HALF_LIFE_MIN`) is an **UNVALIDATED** knob (as
> unobservable as `w`); sweep it. With decay disabled it reduces exactly to
> `synthetic_oi`.

Extended dealer exposure: **VEX** (vanna) and **CHEX** (charm), aggregated on the
SAME VOL basis and locked dealer signs (`+1` call / `-1` put) as the product
GEX/DEX (`engine.exposure_ext`). Optional/additive (mirrors `hiro`/`synthetic_oi`):
absent or `null` when not captured — does **not** bump `schema_version`. The
underlying greeks are finite-difference-validated in `engine.black76`, but the
aggregate has **never been checked against price**.

> **EXPERIMENTAL and NOT price-validated.** Lives **alongside** the locked GEX/DEX
> profile and does **not** replace it. **Units differ from GEX — do not compare
> directly:** `net_vex` is per **1% IV (a vol-point scale)**, NOT per 1% price
> move; `net_chex` is per **calendar day**. `M·F` dollarises each (one `F`, like
> DEX — vanna/charm differentiate delta w.r.t. vol/time, not `F`, so there is no
> `F²`). See `docs/research/empirical/track-f-ddoi-exposure-vol.md`.

| Field | Type | Unit / domain | Meaning | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `net_vex` | `number` | USD δ-notional per 1% IV | Net vanna exposure = `Σ sign·vanna·VOL·M·F·0.01`. EXPERIMENTAL. | FlowGreeks |
| `vex_sign` | `-1 \| 0 \| 1` | enum | Sign of `net_vex`. | FlowGreeks |
| `net_chex` | `number` | USD δ-notional per day | Net charm exposure = `Σ sign·charm·VOL·M·F·(1/365)`. EXPERIMENTAL. | FlowGreeks |
| `chex_sign` | `-1 \| 0 \| 1` | enum | Sign of `net_chex`. | FlowGreeks |

## `total_hedging` (TotalHedging, optional) — **EXPERIMENTAL**

Synthetic-OI #7 total-hedging map (`engine.total_hedging`). Applies all three
hedging greeks (gamma, charm, vanna) to the SAME synthetic dealer position `Q` that
synthetic-OI #4 builds (`Q = s_static·OI_open + (−net_aggressor_flow)·w`, dealer
sign baked in). Optional/additive (mirrors `synthetic_oi`/`exposure_ext`): absent or
`null` when not captured — does **not** bump `schema_version`. Computed only when
the caller supplies signed flow (the `Q` base needs it).

> **EXPERIMENTAL and NOT price-validated.** Lives **alongside** the locked VOL-GEX
> and does **not** replace it. **Three separate terms — never summed:** their units
> differ (price-move / day / vol-point). Because `Q` already carries the dealer
> sign, the greeks are weighted by `Q` directly (no re-applied sign — unlike the
> VOL-based `exposure_ext`). `gamma_hedge` equals the `synthetic_oi.gex` at the same
> `w` (it is GEX on `Q`); `charm_hedge`/`vanna_hedge` add the afternoon-decay and
> vol-sensitivity dimensions a gamma-only map misses. See
> `docs/research/empirical/synthetic-oi-roadmap.md`.

| Field | Type | Unit / domain | Meaning | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `gamma_hedge` | `number` | USD per 1% move | Gamma term `Σ Γ·Q·M·F²·0.01` (== `synthetic_oi.gex` at `w`). | FlowGreeks |
| `charm_hedge` | `number` | USD δ-notional per day | Charm term `Σ charm·Q·M·F·(1/365)`. | FlowGreeks |
| `vanna_hedge` | `number` | USD δ-notional per 1% IV | Vanna term `Σ vanna·Q·M·F·0.01` (vol-point scale). | FlowGreeks |
| `w` | `number` | `[0, 1]` | Open/close flow weight used for the `Q` base. | FlowGreeks |

## `surface` (Surface, optional) — **EXPERIMENTAL**

Vol-surface summary (`engine.surface`): a raw-SVI slice fit to the solved per-leg
IVs (OTM side — put below the forward, call at/above), plus the 1-sigma lognormal
expected move. Optional/additive (mirrors `total_hedging`/`exposure_ext`): absent or
`null` when fewer than 5 non-thin strikes are available — does **not** bump
`schema_version`. The fit is deterministic (stdlib Nelder-Mead) and tested, but it
is **not** a price-validated signal. Carries the raw-SVI params so a consumer can
reconstruct the whole smile. See `docs/research/empirical/synthetic-oi-0dte.md`.

| Field | Type | Unit / domain | Meaning | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `atm_vol` | `number` | annualised, per 1.00 | At-the-money IV from the SVI fit at `k=0`. | FlowGreeks |
| `expected_move` | `number` | index points | 1-sigma lognormal move `F·atm_vol·√T`. | FlowGreeks |
| `skew` | `number` | vol per unit log-moneyness | ATM slope of SVI vol (negative = put skew). | FlowGreeks |
| `rmse` | `number` | vol units | Fit RMSE. | FlowGreeks |
| `arb_free` | `boolean` | — | Gatheral sufficient no-butterfly conditions hold. | FlowGreeks |
| `svi_a` | `number` | variance | Raw-SVI `a` (vertical level). | FlowGreeks |
| `svi_b` | `number` | ≥ 0 | Raw-SVI `b` (slope / wing tightness). | FlowGreeks |
| `svi_rho` | `number` | `(-1, 1)` | Raw-SVI `rho` (skew / rotation). | FlowGreeks |
| `svi_m` | `number` | log-moneyness | Raw-SVI `m` (smile-minimum shift). | FlowGreeks |
| `svi_sigma` | `number` | `> 0` | Raw-SVI `sigma` (ATM curvature smoothness). | FlowGreeks |

## `ddoi` (Ddoi, optional) — **EXPERIMENTAL**

Synthetic **Dealer Directional OI** GEX (`engine.ddoi`): an ALTERNATIVE GEX basis to
the locked VOL. Each trade is classified OPEN vs CLOSE from its intraday TIME
position (early = opening / builds OI, late = closing / squares up before the 0DTE
16:00 ET expiry) to estimate a signed per-leg synthetic ΔOI, then driven through the
SAME locked dealer-sign + gamma template: `gex = Σ (SIGN_C·γ_c·ddoi_c +
SIGN_P·γ_p·ddoi_p)·M·F²·0.01`. Optional/additive (mirrors `synthetic_oi`): absent or
`null` when not captured — does **not** bump `schema_version`. Thin strikes skipped.

> **EXPERIMENTAL and NOT price-validated.** The open/close split is a **time-weight
> heuristic** — the tape does not label open vs close. **Non-circular** (never reads
> official ΔOI) and **orthogonal to VOL** (uses `|size|` + time weight, not the
> aggressor sign). On the 8-day exploratory run it read **FLAT vs the VOL baseline**
> (sign-agreement 49.2% vs 50.8%, within noise) — the *machine* is sound, the edge
> is not proven. Lives **alongside** the locked VOL-GEX and does **not** replace it.
> See `docs/research/empirical/track-f-ddoi-exposure-vol.md`.

| Field | Type | Unit / domain | Meaning | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `gex` | `number` | USD per 1% move | Net synthetic-ΔOI GEX (open/close-classified basis). | FlowGreeks |
| `sign` | `-1 \| 0 \| 1` | enum | Sign of `gex`. | FlowGreeks |
